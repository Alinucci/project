            <p>- Hi Amigo. My name is John Bobrov and I am the captain of the Galactic Rush ship.</p>
            <p style ="color:#4D7DB3FF">- Good afternoon, captain.</p>
            <p>- I will tell you how our educational process works and how to use our service.</p>
            <p>So, the goal of the whole course is to get a lot of fun, good mood and practical programming skills in order to easily get a job as a programmer. And for this we have practical tasks. And there are many of them. Lots of.</p>
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>The entire training course is divided into 4 blocks - quests: Java Syntax, Java Core, Java Multithreading and Java Collections. Each quest consists of 10 levels, and each level contains 10-15 lectures and 20-30 practical tasks.</p>
            <p>You can solve the problems as it suits you: you can directly in the lectures, or you can first read the lectures while you understand them, and solve the problems separately. As you like best.</p>
            <h2>Moving to the next level and to the next lesson</h2>
            <p>Lectures of one quest are opened only sequentially. You won't be able to jump into the middle of the course and try to solve something there. However, once an open lecture is always available. You can return to it at any time to re-read it or re-examine the examples.</p>
            <p><strong>Writing a program</strong> is the most important part of the course. They can be of very different levels, from the simplest tasks to those over which you will have to think a lot.</p>
