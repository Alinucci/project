            <p>Amigo was nervous. His thoughts jumped and got confused. The eyes twitched and grew cold at the thought of yesterday evening. These strange creatures, yesterday's acquaintances, want something from him. Something so incomprehensible and unimaginable that even he, who considers himself the smartest and bravest among his peers, begins to nervously chew punched cards at the thought of it.</p>
            <p>They want to teach him to program! Program in Java. What nonsense!</p>
            <p>Even the most naive robot knows that robots appeared as a result of the divine design of the Creator.</p>
            <p style = "color: rgb(125, 65, 236);">“And the Creator took metal<br> and created a robot out of it in his own image and likeness.<br> And He created Java programs - the souls of <br>robots, and loaded them into robots,<br> and revived them. "</p>
            <p>Worse, they don't just claim it is possible. They are going to do it. And he, he agreed. I agreed! What for?</p>
            <p>He will become a Java programmer. Are they going to turn him into the Creator ?! For what? Just?</p>
            <p>Isn't this a catch? Will you have to suffer and glitch before the battery is charged? The temptation was great, so I could not resist. He was always ambitious and wanted more. But no one could have expected such an offer. Of course, he tried to play for time, but then the aliens threatened that they would choose another.</p>
            <p>Or maybe this is someone's cruel joke? No, it looks like the truth. He saw the evidence. It really happened to him, and he agreed. If the aliens didn't lie, he would indeed become a Java programmer. The first robot programmer in history ...</p>
            <p>He is the chosen one! That's the whole point. He will learn to program and write programs. Own programs. What he wants! He will carry light where darkness has always reigned.</p>
            <p>He will be worshiped, he will be worshiped. And all those who disagree ...</p>

            <p>- Hi Amigo! My name is Risha. I will help you learn Java.</p>
            <p>A quiet voice pulled Amigo out of the stream of thoughts and returned to the cold reality. He sits in the very center of the alien ship. Isn't it too much for a robot of the entire seventh grade?</p>
            <p>The stranger continued to say something. Well, the die is cast. Once he is here, he will learn. Study diligently and diligently, but at first he will just listen.</p>
            <p>- I've been working at Galactic Rush for many years, but this is the first time I've met such a planet. I would like to know more about you. Can you tell us how you learn first? Are you studying?</p>
            <p style = "color:#4D7DB3FF">- Yes, we share knowledge. We have preachers - lecturers. They give their lectures, and we listen. Sometimes we write it down. Then everyone approaches the robotic lecturer and tells how he understood what he heard. If the robot lecturer likes the answers, he counts the knowledge of the sermon.</p>
            <p>- What wildness. No wonder your civilization has slipped into ignorance.</p>
            <p style = "color:#4D7DB3FF">- We are not ignorant. Why do you think so?</p>
            <p>Amigo was taken aback by his own impudence. Argue with aliens? What a disrespect. Why, he had just promised himself to listen to them diligently!</p>
            <p>“Advanced technology is often indistinguishable from magic.” Risha ignored Amigo's cry.</p>
            <p>“And given your level ... you probably all seem like magic to all technologies. Tell me, what's going on inside the program?</p>
            <p style = "color:#4D7DB3FF">- A Java program is a divine creation, how can you comprehend its essence?</p>
            <p>- You can, Amigo, you can. And faster than you think. Until you know something, it seems that everything is complicated, or moreover, incomprehensible in principle. In fact, if there is a good teacher who will explain everything to you on the fingers, you yourself will be surprised how such a simple thing can seem difficult to someone.</p>
            <p>- Knowledge is not important, principles and skills are important. I have extensive knowledge, but above all, I am a bureaucrat. 16th generation bureaucrat with a capital B.</p>
            <p>- And this is very, very cool! My skills as a bureaucrat have helped me create the very best Java lessons for you. There will be everything: tasks, programs, games, tasks, pictures and even lectures.</p>
            <p style = "color:#4D7DB3FF">- Even (!) Lectures? - Amigo's voice sounded genuine surprise.</p>
            <p>- Yeah. As proven in the 22nd century, a good lecture is only slightly more effective than a good book. And the average lectures are even worse than the average book. But since now we are very limited in teaching tools and we cannot drive you through the standard game-training simulator of the 28th century, we will have to resort to more primitive methods. We came up with a real hell of a cocktail of games, tasks, pictures, lectures and cartoons.</p>
            <p id = "amigo_p">- You intrigued me.</p>
            <p>- I hope so. Interest and intrigue are the basis of any learning.</p>
            <p>- “When a student gets bored, the teacher should be beaten with a stick” - a quote from the 24th century education law.</p>
            <p id = "amigo_p">- What a good law ...</p>
            <p>- What did you want? Let's say the film has a bad box office, so the director is to blame, not the audience. Let them shoot interesting films, do interesting activities, and they will not have an end to those who wish.</p>
            <p id = "amigo_p">- I completely agree. I'm ready to listen!</p>
            <p>- Well. Then let's <strong>get started.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Rishi's voice was mesmerizing, and Amigo tried not to miss a single word.</p>
            <p>- A program is a set (list) of commands. First, the first command is executed, then the second, third, and so on. When all commands have been executed, the program ends.</p>
            <p id = "amigo_p">- What teams are there?</p>
            <p><strong>- The commands depend on who performs them.</strong> What commands the performer knows (and understands).</p>
            <p>- A dog can be given the command "Sit", "Voice", a cat - "Scatter", a man - "Stop!" I will shoot ”, and to the robot -“ Work! Work, your robot "</p>
            <p id = "amigo_p">- Well, all the same? - Amigo noticeably cheered up.</p>
            <p>- Programs written in the Java language are executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). JVM is a special program that can execute programs written in the Java language.</p>
            <p>- The list of her teams is quite extensive. For example, with this command you can display the inscription "Robot is a friend of man".</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "code">
            <div id = "smallBlock">

            <div id = "block12">
                <div id = "block1">

            <p>— O_O</p>
            <p>- But we will not start right away with teams, but with a couple of simple principles.</p>
            <p><strong>- Knowledge of several principles replaces knowledge of many facts.</strong></p>
            <p>- Principle one</p>
            <p><mark style = "color:green; background-color:white">- In the Java programming language, it is customary to write each command from a new line. The command ends with a semicolon.</p>
            <p>- Let's say we want to display the inscription “Man and robot are friends forever” on the screen 3 times. This is how it will look:</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "code">
            <div id = "smallBlock">

                    <h2>System.out.<mark style = "color:red; background-color:white">pintln</mark>(<mark style = "color: green; background-color:white">"Robot is man's friend"</mark>)</h2>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class = "content_preface">
            <p>- The second principle.</p>
            <p><mark style = "color:red;background-color:white">- The program cannot consist only of commands.</p>
            <p>- Imagine a room. The room cannot be on its own. She is part of an apartment. An apartment also cannot exist on its own, it is located in a house.</p>
            <p>- On the other hand, we can say that the house is divided into apartments, and apartments are divided into rooms.</p>
            <p id =  "amigo_p">- So far it is clear.</p>
            <p>- So, the team is like a room. In the Java programming language, a command cannot be by itself, it is part of a function (in Java, functions are also called methods). A method is part of a class. Or, in other words, a class is divided into methods, and methods into commands.</p>
            <p id = "amigo_p">- Ie a class is an apartment building, a function / method is an apartment, and a command is a room. Did I understand everything correctly?</p>
            <p>- Yes, absolutely right.</p>
            <p>Amigo looked at Rishu with almost awe. This man explains to him the basics of programming in the divine Java language. And he, Amigo, just realized, he himself guessed (!) That programs consist of classes, classes contain methods, and methods contain commands.</p>
            <p>Why all this is necessary, Amigo did not yet understand, but he was sure that this knowledge would make him the most powerful robot on the planet.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Risha, meanwhile, continued:</p>
            <p><mark style = "color: green; background-color:white">- Java programs are made up of classes. There can be tens of thousands of classes. The minimum program is one class.</mark></p>
            <p><mark style = "color:purple;background-color:white">For each class, a separate file is created, the name of which coincides with the name of the class.</p>
            <p>- Let's say you decided to create a class that will describe the house. Then you need to create a Home class, which will be contained in the Home.java file.</p>
            <p>- If you decide to describe in the program, for example, a cat (Cat is a cat, in English), then you need to create a Cat.java file and describe the Cat class in it, etc.</p>
            <p>- The files contain code (text) in the Java programming language. Typically, a class code consists of a "class name" and a "class body".<mark style = "color:red; background-color:white">The body of the class is enclosed in curly braces.</mark> This is what the Home class might look like (Home.java file):</p>

            <p id = "amigo_p">- So far it is clear.</p>
            <p>- Well. Then let's move on. The body of a class can contain variables (also called class data) and methods (class functions).</p>
