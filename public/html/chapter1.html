            <p>-Hello. If you are reading these lines, then I confirm that these are Java lessons. The course is simply packed with practice (1200+ practical tasks) and is designed for an adult audience. I hate boring lectures, so the course is designed as an online game (quest).</p>
            <p>- Did you have to play and level up characters? Sometimes you yourself don't notice how you get involved, right? Can you guess where I'm going? In this course, you will also have to pump your character. From 1st level to 40th. After completing the entire course, you will become a cool Java programmer.</p>
            <p>- If you pass 40 levels, you can get a job for Java Junior. Although there are individuals who have already found a job at level 20. Because there are many practical tasks in the course. Lots of.</p>
            <p>The game takes place in the distant, distant future, in the year 3017, where people live on Earth with robots, and anyone can travel through space.</p>
            <p>Once a spaceship crashed on an unknown planet ...</p>

            <p>The Galactic Rush team crashed on an unknown planet. When the ship fell, it crashed into the mountain and was almost completely covered with rock debris. Several days were spent in vain attempts to free the ship. The crew lost all hope of returning home and began to settle down in a new place ...</p>
            <p>A week later, Ellie, the ship's navigator, accidentally discovered that the planet was inhabited by ... thousands of wild robots! They could help to take apart the stones and free the ship. But they are very primitive and dumb - they have no skills. They don't even know how to carry stones. Which would be very helpful.</p>
            <p>The scientific leader of the expedition, Professor Noodles, later recalled:<br>
                - A few days later I found a way out. I thought of taking the firmware of the robot Diego, a member of our crew, remaking it for the firmware of the mason and uploading it to the wild robots.</p>
                <p>â€œBut setbacks seemed to haunt us. After a little research, it turned out that the robots do not have a connector for downloading the firmware. They didn't have any flashing connector at all!</p>

            <p>- Bilaabo, the only alien on the crew, remembered that he once saw a robot on his home planet that knew programming. And he didn't just know, but he himself corrected bugs in his own firmware.</p>
            <p>- It was at this moment that a brilliant idea came to me. After all, once upon a time I taught one capable robot to program in Pascal.</p>
            <p>- I ordered to catch the most talented young robot and teach him programming in Java from scratch. Knowing how to program, he could write himself any firmware and help us!</p>

            <p>All in all, we caught one quick-witted specimen. Diego offered to name him Amigo, after his brother, whom he never had.</p>
            <p>- I offered Amigo metal beads for each month of training, and ten dollars a year for the subsequent work to remove the blockage. And this is a lot of savages, because we are engaged in their education for free.</p>

            <p>Diego would later write in his memoirs:</p>
            <p>- I was outraged by such an open robbery of my brother, but the whole team took the side of the professor and Rishi. Of course, I agreed (for show) and offered to help teach Amigo. Hehe! Moreover, no one can teach a robot to program better than another robot.</p>
            <p>- Everyone was so happy about my compliance that they also decided to take an active part in teaching the Java robot Amigo.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- You start from the first level. Your task is to pump Amigo to level 40. But let's start small. First, get to the second level of Java tutorials. Maybe you will like it so much that you will not notice how you complete the course and go to work; )</p>
