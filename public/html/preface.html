            <p>Dear Reader<br><br>
                Many of you have provided feedback on earlier courses, and your comments and
                suggestions have greatly improved the course. This course has been substantially enhanced in
                presentation, organization, examples, exercises, and supplements. The new course:<br>
                ■ Replaces Swing with JavaFX. JavaFX is a new framework for developing Java GUI programs.
                JavaFX greatly simplifies GUI programming and is easier to learn than Swing.<br>
                ■ Introduces exception handling, abstract classes, and interfaces before GUI programming to
                enable the GUI chapters to be skipped completely if the instructor chooses not to cover GUI.<br>
                ■ Covers introductions to objects and strings earlier in Chapter 4 to enable students to use
                objects and strings to develop interesting programs early.<br>
                ■ Includes many new interesting examples and exercises to stimulate student interests. More
                than 100 additional programming exercises are provided to instructors only on the Companion
                Website.<br>
                
                The course is fundamentals first by introducing basic programming concepts and techniques
                before designing custom classes. The fundamental concepts and techniques of selection
                statements, loops, methods, and arrays are the foundation for programming. Building this
                strong foundation prepares students to learn object-oriented programming and advanced Java
                programming.
                We make introductory programming interesting by using thought provoking
                problems in a broad context. The central thread of early chapters is on problem
                solving. Appropriate syntax and library are introduced to enable readers to write programs for
                solving the problems. To support the teaching of programming in a problem-driven way, the
                book provides a wide variety of problems at various levels of difficulty to motivate students.
                To appeal to students in all majors, the problems cover many application areas, including
                math, science, business, financial, gaming, animation, and multimedia.
                The book seamlessly integrates programming, data structures, and algorithms into one text.
                It employs a practical approach to teach data structures. We first introduce how to use various
                data structures to develop efficient algorithms, and then show how to implement these data
                structures. Through implementation, students gain a deep understanding on the efficiency of
                data structures and on how and when to use certain data structures. Finally we design and
                implement custom data structures for trees and graphs.
                The course is widely used in the introductory programming, data structures, and algorithms
                courses in the universities around the world. This comprehensive version covers fundamentals
                of programming, object-oriented programming, GUI programming, data structures, algorithms,
                concurrency, networking, database, and Web programming. It is designed to prepare students
                to become proficient Java programmers. A brief version (Introduction to Java Programming,
                Brief Version, Tenth Edition) is available for a first course on programming, commonly known
                as CS1. The brief version contains the first 18 chapters of the comprehensive version. The first
                13 chapters are appropriate for preparing the AP Computer Science exam.
                The best way to teach programming is by example, and the only way to learn programming
                is by doing. Basic concepts are explained by example and a large number of exercises with various levels of difficulty are provided for students to practice. For our programming
                courses, we assign programming exercises after each lecture.
                Our goal is to produce a text that teaches problem solving and programming in a broad
                context using a wide variety of interesting examples. If you have any comments on and suggestions
                for improving the course, please email me.
