                <h1 id = "body_h1">Week 1: Exploring Data Analysis</h1>
                <p id = "body_p">An introductory overview of the key concepts and techniques for analyzing data.</p>
                <p id = "body_p"><b>NOTE:</b> Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, the workload will be lighter and some of these areas may be pushed to Week 2.</p>
                <h1 id = "body_h1">Topics Covered:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Definitions & Data Types:</strong> Understanding the type of data is essential to<br> understanding what tools one can use to analyze it. You'll cover some basic sorting,<br> frequency distributions and contingency tables. We will use pivot tables for the latter<br> two topics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong>  You'll work to create the appropriate visual display with the<br> appropriate labeling. A good visual display can help make your point clearly without a<br> lot of confusing numbers and technical terms. It also does not have language barriers,<br> so it can be effective with any kind of audience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong>  We'll identify how data clusters, shapes, and can be distorted,<br> covering some handy tools and guidelines that will serve you well when taking your<br> first look at a data set.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Probability:</strong>  Percentages and probabilities are used in everyday life and they are<br> even more important in business.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1 id = "body_h1">Week 2: Sampling and Estimation</h1>
                <p id = "body_p">Continuing on the work with probability, focusing on two continuous probability<br> distributions; the uniform and the norma</p>
                <h1 id = "body_h1">Topics Covered:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Properties of the Uniform & Normal Distribution:</strong>  The uniform has a rectangular shape<br> and is useful when representing purely random events. Understanding some of the<br> fundamentals of the normal (also known as a bell curve) distribution is also a key<br> element in understanding how to analyze business data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Survey & Sampling:</strong>  You'll cover the basics of surveying and go through an overview<br> of the process of sampling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence Interval for Means and Proportions:</strong>  You’ll learn how two different<br> confidence intervals can be used to estimate sales for a new business venture or our<br> new product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Application</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <h1 id = "body_h1">Week 3: Hypothesis Testing </h1>
                <p id = "body_p">You'll cover hypothesis testing, one of the more challenging topics in statistics.</p>
                <h1 id = "body_h1">Topics Covered:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing Basics: </strong> What it is, how it's evolved, and how hypothesis tests can <br>relate to various growing business markets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing for Means & Proportions:</strong> We'll go through the step-by-step<br> process of creating and performing tests for means and proportions – think<br> percentages – and we'll do this in Excel. This all leads up to the “p-value” - a common<br> metric that is applied to all hypothesis tests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Errors:</strong>   We'll cover some of the various errors that occur with hypothesis testing<br> and the business implications that may result from those errors.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1 id = "body_h1">Week 4: Linear Models</h1>
                <p id = "body_p">We'll move away from the more statistical topics to talk about linear equations. We will still<br> rely heavily on Excel to crunch the numbers and will build off of what we’ve learned thus far.</p>
                <h1 id = "body_h1">Topics Covered:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finding the Equation of a Line</li>
